Today software engineer from Alexandria should come to the Station, I'm thinking about is it better if i stay quiet and listen what he says or give him some questions 
Ok he came. But he is not even a software engineer, he is jst a manager of university which needs money, it was just a commercial of university, that was bullshit
I added get by Id section and fixed some bugs in Project, now it's done. 
Make books list project with Typescript  is next i think, or i should make this project's client version first? But.. i didn't code frontend so long that my hands needs get used to it
